Brief Description: Apocalyptic, scary and suspenseful environment where we want to survive as long as possible the zombie invasion that intends to kill the main character (the player), who is the only person immune to the deadly virus that has wiped out humanity, COVID-19. The objective is to use the available resources, strategic skills and critical thinking to try to withstand the continuous invasion of zombies as much as possible and survive.
In addition, there is a set of music suitable for this type of game, taken directly from the inspiration for this project, Call Of Duty Zombies.

As you progress through the game, it is possible to teleport from one environment to another. The main environment is a small area, with some holes, a bus and an elevator. And the second map already features a more open space with stairs and small houses to use as a shelter and create new strategies.
To survive, the player must know how to move, predict the zombies' steps, use the map and the environment to his advantage and use the weapons available to defeat the zombies in the 3D environment around him. However, in this game it is not possible to win, the only thing you can do is temporarily postpone the inevitable.
